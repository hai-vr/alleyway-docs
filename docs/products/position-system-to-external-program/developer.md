# Developer documentation

All the documentation of this website is meant for users of the application, not developers.

If you are a developer, you should consult the [README.md on GitHub](https://github.com/hai-vr/position-system-to-external-program/)
for technical information about the extraction process, the shader, the WebSockets API, and the camera position extraction.
