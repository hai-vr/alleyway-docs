### Docusaurus notes

- I could not initialize docusaurus with npx unless I manually created the `npm/` folder in Roaming.
- I had to go to Settings/Actions/General and set *Workflow permissions* to *Read and write* permissions
  so that GitHub workflows could read it.
- Most stuff copied from [hai-vr/documentation](https://github.com/hai-vr/documentation).
